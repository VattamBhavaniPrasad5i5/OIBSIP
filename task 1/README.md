# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples for each of three different species of iris (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). For each sample, four features are measured: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its features. This is a supervised learning problem, and we will use several machine learning algorithms to train our models and evaluate their performance.

## Data
The Iris flower dataset can be loaded directly from several machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn and TensorFlow. In this repository, we will use the version of the dataset provided by scikit-learn.

## Algorithms
We will train several different machine learning algorithms on the Iris flower dataset, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Gussian
We will evaluate the performance of each algorithm using cross-validation and other techniques.

## Results
The results of our experiments will be presented in the form of accuracy scores. We will also visualize the decision boundaries of our models to gain a better understanding of how they work.

## Conclusion
In this project, we have explored the Iris flower classification problem and trained two different machine learning algorithms to solve it. We have evaluated the performance of each algorithm and presented our results in a clear and concise manner. This repository can serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about machine learning algorithms and their applications to classification problems.
